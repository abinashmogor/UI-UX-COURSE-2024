                <hr>
                <p>Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise origin of
                    the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the
                    fourth century AD.[16] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may
                    contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to
                    provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and
                    insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.[17]

                    According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne, referred
                    to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by Ne, the
                    country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.[18][19][d] According to Nepāl
                    Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.[20] According to Buddhist
                    mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley
                    and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would settle it. As the
                    cherished of Ne, the valley would be called Nepāl.[21] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali, the
                    genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c. 1380s, Nepal is named after Nepa the cowherd, the
                    founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot,
                    at which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also named Ne.[17]
